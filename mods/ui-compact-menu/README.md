Combine city construction menu icons into categories: tourists, public services, institutions, malls and administration.

## Notes

This mod does not recreate the whole menu, but only combines what is correctly added.
Some mods add their icon only to either progression type sorting or category type sorting.
Please contact the respective mod authors for fixes.

Buildings from Muggenstuermer and Xan are included.

Contact me if you have any mod conflicts so that I can take care of them.
