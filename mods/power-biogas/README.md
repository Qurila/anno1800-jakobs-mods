# Biogas Plant

![](./banner.png)

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

The biogas plant converts dung from animal farms into gas for use in power plants.

Needs "The Passage" DLC activated. "Seeds of Change" DLC is not required.

## Notes

The mod comes with two buildings.

The dung depot provides a buff to nearby animal farms in the OW and NW to produce extra dung.

The biogas plant processes dung into gas.

Biogas: 1,33/min using 3 dung per cycle
Dung per any farm (OW): 0,5/min or 1/min with silo
Dung production NW is same as with the Fertilizer building and will not stack.

You find the biogas production in materials and embedded in the gas and small power plants construction menus.
