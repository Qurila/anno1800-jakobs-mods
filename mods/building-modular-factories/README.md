# Modular Factories

Factory buildings merge into bigger factory blocks like engineer and investor residences do.

You find the buildings in the respective production chain menus.

The buildings are intended visual alternatives without any gameplay benefit.
Their cost and cycles are adjusted to their changed footprint.

### Buildings

- Sewing Machines: 7 variations, 4x4 tiles, 1/3 cost and production cycles.
- (Tools are part of the `[Shared] Extra Goods (Jakob)` mod)
- more will follow ...
