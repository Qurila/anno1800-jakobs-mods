[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

Includes a small hotel with 4 variations and many paintbrush skins for both small and normal hotel.

## New World Tourism

The small hotels and normal hotel skins can be used in the New World if you use the [New World Tourism](https://github.com/anno-mods/New-World-Tourism) mod.

The unlocks for the Christo Redentor monument are changed as well.
Now 1500 Tourists are needed for construction and 2500 to unlock the basic need.

Note: you may still see the old unlocks, but the new unlocks should be still in effect.
