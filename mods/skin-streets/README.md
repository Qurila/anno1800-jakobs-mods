# Improved Street Skins

Exchanges the New World street texture with a more fitting one.

## Notes

Street and railroad assets are untouched, only their texture is changed.
No game update troubles or compatibility issues with other mods are expected.

You need to rebuild bridges if you want the right color after activating this mod.
Likewise, if you deactivate the mod those new bridges will disappear.

The railroad texture is inspired by [Gravel Railway Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/391) by Bluesatin.
It is essentially a heavily retextured version of it. Bump map has been recreated.

## Changes

- 1.2: added NW stone bridge
- 1.1: added railroad skin
