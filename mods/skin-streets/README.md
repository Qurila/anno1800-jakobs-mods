Exchange railway and New World stone street textures with visually improved versions.

## Notes

Street and railway assets are untouched, only their texture is changed.
No game update troubles or compatibility issues with other mods are expected.

You need to rebuild bridges if you want the right color after activating this mod.
Likewise, if you deactivate the mod those new bridges will disappear.

The railway texture is inspired by [Gravel Railway Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/391) by Bluesatin.

## Changes

- 1.3: disable railway skin when the mod `Stone Railway` is active
- 1.2: added NW stone bridge
- 1.2: improved compatibility with City Ornaments
- 1.1: added railway skin
