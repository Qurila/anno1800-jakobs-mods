# Improved Street Skins

Exchanges the New World street texture with a more fitting one.

## Notes

The change does not affect save games.
You can safely add and remove this mod any time.

The railroad texture is inspired by [Gravel Railway Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/391) by Bluesatin.
It is essentially a heavily retextured version of it. Bump map has been recreated.
