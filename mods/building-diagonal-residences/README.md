Add diagonal residences and ornaments to break up the standard grid.

## Buildings

Use Shift+V to cycle through variations before you place it.
You need to relocate if you want to change an existing building.

Buildings are fully functional, but expect some visual and user experience oddities as there is no true diagonal support.

### Residences

- Diagonal investors: including Vibrant Cities and 3 custom skins

- Skins matching jje's red tile roof buildings for engineers

### Ornaments

- Diagonal enclosed greenery on plaza and stone pavement
- Skins with diagonal and other corner variations for fences and park paths
