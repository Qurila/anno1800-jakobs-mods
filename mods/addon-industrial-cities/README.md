## Notes and Known Issues

- There is no cross progression from upgraded residences to their next population tier.
You have to downgrade to normal residences first - just like the skyscrapers handle it. This is due to technical reasons.
- (workers only) The game always prefers one direction when building a single row of houses. You have to rotate such a building everytime you place or upgrade it or its neighbors.
- The arrows for skyscraper upgrade don't show sometimes. The buildings will upgrade if you click anyway.
