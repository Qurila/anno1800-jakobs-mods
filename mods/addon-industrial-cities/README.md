# Industrial Cities

![](./banner.jpg)

Increased population residences, new productions, railway stations, more power stations.

## Requirements

- Residences require activated DLC `The High Life`

## Buildings

### Residences - Terraced Houses

- Worker Level 1: 30 workers
- Worker Level 2: 40 workers
- Artisan Level 1: 50 artisans
- Artissan Level 2: 70 artisans

You can either use the skyscraper upgrade button (recommended), or the build menu as a fallback in case of mod conflicts.

Use short-cut "I" to get into skyscraper upgrade mode before unlocking engineer/investor skyscrapers.

There is no cross progression from upgraded residences to their next population tier.
You have to downgrade to normal residences first - just like the skyscrapers handle it. This is due to technical reasons.

You find more dense farmer workforce population in `[Addon] Pescatarians (Jakob)`.

## Known Issues

- (workers only) The game always prefers one direction when building a single row of houses. You have to rotate such a building everytime you place or upgrade it or its neighbors.
- The arrows for skyscraper upgrade don't show sometimes. The buildings will upgrade if you click anyway.
