# Jakob's Collection - Anno 1800 Mods

New tiers, products, industries and more than 300 new visual assets (custom models, variations, skins, ...).

## Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods/releases)

- Be sure how to use either the [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases) mod manager or the [Anno Mod Loader](https://github.com/xforce/anno1800-mod-loader) directly.
- Make sure you always have the latest version of the Anno Mod Loader installed. Mods won't show up after game updates otherwise.

## Changes

Versions are always kept compatible, except when game updates force me to do differently.

Rebalancing of productions may only happen when the first version number changes, but they are still save to use in existing savegames.

See full [changelog](./doc/CHANGELOG.md).

## v5 Update Guide

### Install

Mod names have changed, most notably they got `(Jakob)` at the end to help you manage bigger collections.

That unfortunately means you need to take extra care updating this time.

- Easy way: Install via [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases).

- Manual way: Delete all v4 mods before you install v5, mostly because folder names have changed.

### In-game Changes

In-game changes, that need your attention:

- Upgradable Workers now have Tea as mandatory need with Cheese moving to alternative needs.
- Pescatarians have changed and rebalanced needs. Check your islands if you need to adjust your productions.
