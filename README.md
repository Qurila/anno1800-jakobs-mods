# Jakob's Collection - Anno 1800 Mods

New tiers, products, industries and more than 300 new visual assets (custom models, variations, skins, ...).

## Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods/releases)

- Be sure how to use either the [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases) mod manager or the [Anno Mod Loader](https://github.com/xforce/anno1800-mod-loader) directly.
- Make sure you always have the latest version of the Anno Mod Loader installed. Mods won't show up after game updates otherwise.

## Changes

Versions are always kept compatible, except when game updates force me to do differently.

Rebalancing of productions may only happen when the first version number changes, but they are still save to use in existing savegames.

See full [changelog](./doc/CHANGELOG.md).
